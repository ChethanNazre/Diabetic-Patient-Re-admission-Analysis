# Diabetic-Patient-Re-admission-Analysis
Predicting the Impact on Re-admission Rates for Hospitalized Diabetic Patients

## Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of hospital re-admission for diabetic patients using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing patient data, we identify key factors influencing re-admission rates and develop predictive models to assist healthcare providers in reducing avoidable hospitalizations.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains records of diabetic patients, including:
- Demographic details
- Medical history
- Lab results
- Medication details
- Previous hospital visits and re-admissions

## Objectives
- Identify the key factors contributing to patient re-admission.
- Develop predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
- Improve hospital management by reducing unnecessary re-admissions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding data distributions and correlations.
3. **Model Selection:** Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models.
4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model performance.
5. **Evaluation:** Comparing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
6. **Deployment (Optional):** Creating an API or web interface for predictions.

## Results
- Identified key features affecting re-admission rates.
- Achieved high accuracy and precision with optimized machine learning models.
- Developed insights for improving patient care and reducing hospital re-admissions.
